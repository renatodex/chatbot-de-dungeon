We still don't have a final name for this project, so it is what it is!

This is a monorepo where the idea is to hold experiments we are going to do mixing 3 basic ingredients which all has their own complexity on it's on, which are:

1. A Telegram Bot (or any other bot we think about along the way)
2. A RPG Solo based on Text, possibly with combat
3. An AI approach to generate a procedural unique world depending on users inputs.

Since this is complex, and we still need to understand what will emerge in the end of this world, all you can do now probably is to **wish us luck**!
